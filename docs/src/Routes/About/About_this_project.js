            <p>
                In 2017 I finished (successfully) my studies of computer science. Enjoying Python,
                being a fan of Martin Fowler and Uncle Bob, favoring functional programming,
                I have innocently become a <em>front end developer</em> and felt pretty much like&nbsp;
                <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f">this guy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So this project is just a playground for me. Trying some things out and
                making my own mistakes from the very beginning (making his own errors
                is in my opinion the most efficient way to learn). To cut things short,
                I see two features for me in this website:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Try improving programming without programming is like learning swimming without water;
                    so I program this website...
                </li>
                <li>
                    Writing things down is cumbersome and slow. Which is somehow a good thing, because it enforces
                    rethinking and reevaluating. Specially in modern web development,
                    where there are thousands of ways of doing something, this is a very good thing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you by accident stumbled over this website, or I treacherously lured you into it,
                you can click on the header now, to open the table of contents
                and "join" me on my <em>quest of Web Programming</em>.
