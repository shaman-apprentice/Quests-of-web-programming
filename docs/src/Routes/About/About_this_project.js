                In 2017 I finished (successfully) my studies of computer science. Enjoying Python,
                being a fan of Martin Fowler and Uncle Bob, favoring functional programming,
                I have innocently become a <em>front end developer</em> and felt pretty much like&nbsp;
                <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f">this guy</a>.

                So this project is just a playground for me. Trying some things out and
                making my own mistakes from the very beginning (making his own errors
                is in my opinion the most efficient way to learn).
